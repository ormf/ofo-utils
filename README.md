# ofo-utils

Utilities for overtone (VUmeters, sample-players, misc.). Some parts
of the code contain modified code from overtone. References are
specified in the sources.

### Installation

```sh
    # Install lein2
    # https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

    $ lein new ofo-utils-test

    # add the following dependencies to ofo-utils-test/project.clj
    # [org.clojure/clojure "1.6.0"]
    # [ofo-utils "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]

    $ cd ofo-utils-test
    $ lein repl
```

### Making sounds


```clj
    ;; boot the server
    user=> (use 'ofo-utils.core)

    ;; add a Stereo VUmeter
    user=> (vumeter)

    ;; add another 16 channel VUmeter, listening on supercollider
    ;; buses 0 through 15

    user=> (vumeter (range 16))

    ;; add a 4 channel VUmeter, listening on supercollider's first two
    ;; input and output buses

    user=> (vumeter [8 9 0 1])

    ;; listen to the joys of a simple sine wave and watch its output
    ;; in the vumeter(s)
    
    user=> (demo (sin-osc))

    ;; load a sampled-piano synth (this is an extended sampled piano
    ;; from standard overtone, enabling float values for microtonal
    ;; midi values and an optional duration argument. Beware this
    ;; takes a long time to load for the first time as the samples
    ;; have to get downloaded to the sample pool on the local
    ;; harddrive first.

    user=> (use 'ofo-utils.synth.sampled-piano)
    
    ;; play a midi c
    user=> (sampled-piano 60)

    ;; play a midi c plus one quartertone
    user=> (sampled-piano 60.5)

    ;; play a staccato note
    user=> (sampled-piano 60 :dur 0.1)
